# NFT-Locked-ERC20Token
Creating an ERC-20 Standard Token with NFT lock that limits who can purchase and hold the token by ownership of specific NFT

The purpose of this project is to create a standard code base that can be used for future ERC20 Token deployments such that only people who are approved (through ownership of the associated NFT) can interact with the contract and hold the token. This way when it is put onto a Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange such as uniswap it blocks crypto front runner bots that target low liquidity and early stage projects.

Put in plain english 

"The purpose of this project is to create a smart contract, a computer program that runs on the blockchain, that can be used for future deployments of ERC20 tokens. This smart contract is designed to ensure that only approved individuals can interact with the contract and hold the token. Approval is determined through ownership of a specific NFT (non-fungible token).

This smart contract is intended to be used in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap to block crypto front runner bots that target low liquidity and early stage projects. The use of an NFT to determine token ownership provides an additional layer of security and ensures that only approved individuals can participate in the project.

In simple terms, This smart contract is a way to create a new cryptocurrency, that can be traded on decentralized exchanges and ensures that only people who own a specific digital asset can interact with and hold the token, this is an additional layer of security that can be used to prevent bots and other malicious actors from taking advantage of low liquidity and early stage projects."
